### Does OnlyHtml support React?

React, Svelte and Vue are all great web frameworks and personaly I just love Svelte, but do we really need all this complexity for most websites? OnlyHtml tries to prove a thesis that we can do most things without javascript, and when we must simpler frameworks that don't require heavy dependecies can do the job perfectly. 

For the record, OnlyHtml does not force not using React or any other framework, it's just not conifgured to do so out of the box.
