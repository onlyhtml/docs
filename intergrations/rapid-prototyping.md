# Rapid Prototyping

The rapid prototyping back-end helps designing websites without worrying about the content. When you like the look of the website you can switch to a different back-end and start filling up actual meaningful content. Getting started with a rapid prototyping back-end is simple, just run:

```
git clone https://github.com/onlyhtml/starter-vanila.git
cd starter-vanila
npm install

# start the servers
onlyhtml serve rapid
```

This will start a server with a "lorem-ipsum" backend, it detects which fields are in each page and generates random content to fill the page. Images will be filled up with random images from free image servers.

{% hint style="info" %}
Lorem Ipsum is a piece of text, used by designers to fill a space where the content will eventually sit. It helps show how text will look once a piece of content is finished, during the planning phase.
