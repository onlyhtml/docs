# Backends

OnlyHtml is a static site generator that allows you to edit your content in multiple content back-ends. It deduces the structure and schema of your site and integrates with Headless CMSs to configure a matching dashboard. 

To make development even faster, OnlyHtml is has Rapid back-end baked in. This Rapid back-end generates random content so you don't have to. It will help you get an idea if the design looks good faster. When you are ready you can switch to any other supported back-end. 

Here are the different backends that are supported:

### Implemented

{% page-ref page="rapid-prototyping.md" %}

{% page-ref page="sanity.io.md" %}

### Planned

{% page-ref page="local-files.md" %}
